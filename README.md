# FerrisChat Client

# THIS CLIENT IS DEPRECATED!! PLEASE USE the [New Client](https://github.com/FerrisChat/Client)

Fuck Discord's laggy, shitty, memory-eating client. It's a disgrace upon this world.

Enter the world of Ferris! Ferris is here to save everyone from the hell that is Electron.

One day Ferris aspires to be at the core of the fastest, leanest, and most feature-rich
chat app ever written. But until that day arrives, this is where Ferris will oversee
the entirety of development.

# Contributing

**NOTE: THIS IS THE REPO FOR THE CLIENT ONLY!!!**

Basically look at the issues, and see if there's something you can help with.
Look at the issue thread and make sure no one's claimed it yet. If no one has, go
ahead and write a comment saying you're claiming it.

You must run `rustfmt` **with default settings** on a PR for it to be merged.
